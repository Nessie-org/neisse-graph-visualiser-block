# neisse-graph-visualiser-block

A [Nessie](https://github.com/Nessie-org) block that takes a graph data structure and returns an interactive HTML visualisation.

---

## Overview

`neisse-graph-visualiser-block` exposes a single action — `visualise_graph` — which accepts a graph object and returns a self-contained HTML string that renders the graph visually in any browser or webview.

---

## Action

### `visualise_graph`

Renders a graph data structure as an HTML visualisation.

| Field         | Details                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Action**    | `visualise_graph`                |
| **Payload**   | `Graph`                      |
| **Returns**   | `String` — HTML content          |
| **Side effects** | None                          |
| **Setup required** | None                       |

#### Payload

```json
{
  "Graph": <Graph>
}
```

The `Graph` object should describe nodes and edges in the format expected by the block's underlying renderer. See [Usage](#usage) for an example.

#### Return value

A `String` containing a complete, self-contained HTML document (or embeddable HTML fragment) that renders the supplied graph. This can be written to a file, injected into a `<div>`, or loaded inside an `<iframe>`.

## Usage

```js
const result = await block.run("visualise_graph", {
  Graph: {
    nodes: [
      { id: "A", label: "Node A" },
      { id: "B", label: "Node B" },
      { id: "C", label: "Node C" }
    ],
    edges: [
      { from: "A", to: "B" },
      { from: "B", to: "C" }
    ]
  }
});

// result is an HTML string — render it however you like
document.getElementById("graph-container").innerHTML = result;
```
